Hey there! Welcome to my blog. My name is Naveen Tirupattur, and I'm passionate about technology. 
Here, I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on AI/ML, Data and Distributed Systems.

## My Story

I am a Staff Engineer and I have been working in the tech industry for over 15 years. 
I have built and scaled distributed systems, and have worked on a variety of problems in the data space. I am passionate about building products that are scalable, reliable and performant.
I started this blog to share my learnings and experiences with the broader community. I hope to inspire and educate others who are interested in technology.
