As companies race to adopt AI/ML into their workflows and products, the need for a cohesive data strategy has never been
more important. This wave of AI/ML adoption is being driven by the huge improvements in the capabilities of models via 
novel architectures and cloud computing that has democratized the ability to train/deploy/host these models at scale. 
However, the another important factor is the ubiquity of data available for training and inference. This has been made 
possible by the 2010s wave of Big Data that led to emergence of tools and platforms to collect, ingest, process and 
store huge amounts of data. 

Having the right data is more important than having a lot of data. The right data can be defined as: 1. data that is relevant to the problem you are trying to solve. 2. data that you can trust (this is a bit more nuanced, I will explain this in detail below).

## Unpacking Data Trustworthiness: A Critical Component
Let's dive deeper on the second point - data that you can trust. This is a very important aspect of data that is often overlooked. I feel the quality of the data is more important than the quality of the model. This is because, even the best model will not perform well if the data is of poor quality. 

What is trustworthy data? 
* data that is accurate, complete and consistent.
* data that is free from biases, and anomalies.
* data that is discoverable, well-documented, well-understood, and well-organized. 
* data that is compliant with regulations and has privacy guardrails.

A cohesive and a comprehensive data platform is a pre-requisite for right data. In this post I will focus on a few key aspects of a data platform that are important for building trust in data: observability, discovery, provenance, lineage and governance.

### Observability
Data observability is the ability to measure and monitor the state of data.  for correctness, completeness, and consistency.

### Discovery

### Provenance

### Lineage

### Governance
